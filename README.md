# Ulearn

Ulearn is a new concept platform which aims at connecting people that want to teach with those that want to learn. At the moment it has only been materialized in the form of a mobile app, and we expect to develop soon a website and other forms of online presence. Here we present the hypothetical features as well as the first prototype of the app.

## Motivations

PONER ALGO DE QUE (1) GLOBALISATION/TECHNOLOGY CADA VEZ INFLUENCIA MAS EN LA FORMA DE CONOCER GENTE, O DE QUE (2) LOS NEGOCIOS PERSONALES (DE PARTICULAR A PARTICULAR) CADA VEZ GANAN MAS PESO, Y UNO MUY IMPORTANTE ES EL TUTORING.

USAR ESTO TAMBIEN:
Ulearn takes advantage of the already-established communities:

(1) Students at school, or university campuses
(2) Neighbors in our block and district
(3) Colleagues at work

Besides their jobs and duties, these people have passions and skills that they want to share, practice or master



As a team of passionate engineers attending the NUS Singapore Hack&Roll Hackathon, we decided to take advantage of this unsatisfied necessity by developing a novel and innovative solution: Ulearn. (MOLARIA PONER EL NOMBRE CON LA MISMA FUENTE QUE EN EL PPT)

## Concept

A smartphone app 
takes advantage of the already-established communities:
• Students at school, or university campuses
• Neighbors in our block and district
• Colleagues at work
Besides their jobs and duties, these people have passions and skills that they want to share, practice or master

Teachers: Paid for their lessons, Gain prestige by rating, Decide on pricing
Students: Select their teachers, Rate their teaching skills, Establish contact
Agree on the schedule and meetup location, Determine their knowledge areas of interest and expertise

The app is designed to connect people that are close – thus saving them from a long journey to their their class. Finding the teacher you want is only a tap away!

Save money by saving time; make money by teaching your skills. Choose the teacher that best adapts to your needs and budget.

Ratings for all users (both teaching and being taught) ensures quality of customers. Show them your best self!

## Phone App

ADAPTAR TODO:::
Main features:
* Various recipes (levels) accessed on a remote database
* Online account management
* Score and achievments sharing with friends
* Real-time communication with the device
* Feedback such as: "increase/decrease temperature", "give a stir" or "food is burning"

The early prototype was developed with Unity game engine and featured one full recipe. The Android version is already available for feedback on [Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.SevaneGames.SmartChef).


## What comes next

ADAPTAR TODO:::
Additional features that could potentially be implemented:
* Allow the user to rate recipes and suggest improvements, use machine learning to update the database based on the score given by many users
* Advanced feedback to the user using fuzzy logic
* Automatic ingredients ordering to local groceries with home delivery
